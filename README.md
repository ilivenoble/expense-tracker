## Overview

Tired of wondering where your money went to? Worry no more.
The Expense Tracker App let's you track your income and expenses by keeping a history of all transactions you entered.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- React.JS
- React Context API
- Vite

By building this, I tested my knowledge of basic react topics like useState, React Forms and advanced topics like React Context API, and useReducer.

### Continued development
I planned to make this application a full-stack app where it can allow for authentication and storing of user's expense history in a database.
